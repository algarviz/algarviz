#### Hi there üëã I'm √Ålvaro!

Born in Madrid, Spain. My formal studies are in Advertising and Multimedia Communications. However I had been always tinkering with computers since I was a little kid. Therefore some time ago I decided to recicle myself and pursuit a professional career in web and app development.
